The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\\\"  \\\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.

Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.

Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face.\\\" \\\"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.\\\" Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.

They had his windows down, so he was not as they could not hear them.\\\" The renters of the vehicles of the government left and assembled of altercation.  The event sequence gets to be confused at this point.  Some witnesses indicate the instigadas discussions the conductors of GAStech with protestors, and others think that the officials of the government began to intimidate the demonstrators of the way. \\\"It is to people in the cars of the government were police,\\\" Mabel says.  \\\"He used the uniforms and had currencies.\\\" The Onlookers says that the three parties began to shout, and in a certain point the police of Kronos - of Abila- it arrested five activists it probably transported and them to a jail of Elodis.

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death. Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, \\\"Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high.\\\" However, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone.   \",\"   ABILA, Kronos - The brazen day time assault on two peace officers by the POK is just another violent, terroristic act in a long string of such acts.\",\" Modernization, 6:10 PM:  The executive jet of GAStech according to as reported it has arrived in Tethys Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of the bearing of some hours ago.

These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - A Protectors of Kronos demonstration in the streets of the Siopa district in downtown Abila resulted in numerous incidents of vandalism and opportunistic looting yesterday.  Crowd members spray painted the new POK logo on buildings and cars, broke shop windows, looted stores, and intimidated innocent bystanders.  The police were forced to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse the group of hooligans.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - The Protectors of Kronos (POK) are suspected of kidnapping up to fourteen GAStech employees from their headquarters building earlier today.  Abila police quickly secured the building and interviewed the remaining GAStech employees.

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.   \\\"We're trying to get the attention of our government,\\\" he told the Homeland Illumination.  \\\"This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event.\\\" He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies.  \\\"They need to be aware that we know what they're doing,\\\" added Vardshvna.  \\\"You can't just steal our money and think you can get away with it.\\\" Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.  She had just turned ten years old.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19.     Government officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their \\\"safety is of the utmost importance. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear.    The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: \\\"They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year.\",\" This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. Pondo Reese, editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the Tiskele River.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. \\\"It took a long time for anyone to respond,\\\" Reese tells me of their struggle.  \\\"Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started.\\\" Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records. \\\"It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.\\\" Has it been worth it? \\\"You tell me,\\\" Reese nods out his window.

Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it. However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign \\\"experts\\\" who claim to \\\"have our best interests at heart\\\" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization. \",\" Update, 1:50 PM:  We have tried twenty more phone numbers at GAStech, but no one else has answered.

Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO. At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place.  Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member. Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \\\"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal.\\\" Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned. \",\" ABILA, Kronos - the thousands of demonstrators who take the flags that read \\\"remember Julian\\\" and singing \\\"we wished truth\\\" reunited in front of the morning of Saturday of the governmental offices of Kronos.

In the confusion from the building evacuation an accurate count of GAStech employees is nearly impossible.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting?  The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis.  In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed.  Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence.  The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \\\"public threat\\\".\",\" 7 of September of 2012 ABILA, Kronos - the thousands of people aligned the ways Thursday in an exhibition of solidarity antigovernment. Between the demonstrators it was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, of the coast of the west of Kronos.   \\\"We are trying to obtain the attention of our government,\\\" he said.  \\\"This is important, so I took time extinguished from the work to be a part of this important event.\\\" It was one of whom they handled his energy of the free speech to express his preoccupation with the present deficiency of the transparency of the government with the money public.  \\\"They need to be found out that we know what is doing,\\\" added Vardshvna.  \\\"You cannot as soon as to rob our money and to think she can obtain to him far with him.\\\" The posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Julian Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by the leaders and innocents.    Its death, thought to be a murder by many, urged annul meetings to bring the message of the protectors of Kronos to the public.  Julian Vann died in 1998 of the cancer caused by environmental toxins in its potable water.

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate. \\\"We didn't make the connection at first,\\\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\\\" The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf\\u00e9 where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \\\"We've made a good living for a long time,\\\" Reese tells me. \\\"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\\\" I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.   I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

The POK was launched to give the attention to the clean questions of water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source from both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis.  In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report/ratio released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value.  Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, one ten years previously healthy - the old maid died of a prolonged disease, which WFA-a placed of the claimed doctors was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK first and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since.  The martyrdom in the second place principal of POK is Elan Carol, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes.

Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said.  The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.   The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.    Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \\\"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life.

Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the \\\"exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism\\\" and alleging, \\\"GAStech poisoned our kids\\\".   Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.

In the past it has had a corrupt reputation like and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the previous business of Tethys-only, is trying to gain the confidence of international investors. This form the part of its ambitions to extend its gas that provides with the beneficial business outside the Mediterranean region. It is an ascending task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the capacity to convince potential investors that it has repaired his ways, and it is rooted not more in the past echo-hostile. The operations of the pipe of GAStech are based on Kronos of the east, and is near relation with the government of Kronosian. This one is the heart of the business of the pipe of Kronos, where the gas of the gas fields of the east settles tubes to the west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech does more than as soon as the gas of the pump. It has created cities and cities to maintain his operations, that it handles and it works almost single-giving. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, that photo watches fixedly towards outside calendars and of marks throughout in the country, recognizes \\\"state inside the accusations of a state\\\", but she discusses that the necessities of the company simply to take care of his workers and of the communities around them. By all means, to populate the good reasons with the necessity to come and to work in the hostile remote regions of Kronosian. They provide medical aid, the hospitality, and the food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of the company, it works gyms, and it offers subsidized holidays in the resources of the Black Sea for the dominant employees. For the executives, it works a state extreme extra, a medical center and of the marble-aligned therapy. In addition to all these allowances, there is also the station of GAStech TV, that does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there serving the will as the company. It looks like as soon as the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unloaded little ceremonious their \\\"activities of the not-heart\\\". There is a discussion, nevertheless, that the business of the energy is different from other industries, requiring the corporations of the energy to work of different ways. Working in remote places without previous means of the infrastructure to lubricate and the sites of the gas they will be always, until certain point, cities of the company. GAStech makes certainly an effort to assure its employees can move inside and outside these locations working a deprived fleet of four planes to ferry across to its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - to follow the annual executives of GAStech of meeting of the company of GAStech-Kronos and several civils servant of government of the high row of Kronos will deal with one evening with the capital building of Kronos to celebrate the released kleptocracy which maintained the civils servant public of Kronos in the manors and the vehicles of luxury. Waiting with hearing which President Kapelou Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of II and PRESIDENT must say about the way in which this profane alliance profited the citizens from Kronos.  \",\" <<deleted the image of Elian Karel speaking with a gathering in Abila>> The voice of the protest for some, the demagog of popularist for others, guards of the Chief Elian Karel de Kronos became a gathering martyrdom and point for some; a figure of scorn and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern with the government of Kronosian, in one year filled by event, accentuated by its suspicious death Friday.  The chief of an environmental group forbearant of activist, Karel had begun a mark of the policy all his clean, which propelled the POK in the projector of this nation of island. Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things. By ressuscitant embers of Juliana Vann to make countryside, the 10 year old girl who died of the diseases allotted to the industrial jets of reject of the government-favoured company of GASTech in 1998, Karel was stopped and thrown in prison according to a human stopping of road POK-launched in front of registered offices of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death. Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, \\\"Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high.\\\" However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.   \",\" It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region. It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \\\"state within a state\\\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. Of course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre. In addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will. It hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their \\\"non-core activities\\\". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues.

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed.

Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.  Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.

Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.  With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.     The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.     The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \\\"public threat\\\".\",\" The world of the gas distant, difficult and is thrown far. In Tethys some years ago, I traveled laborious to the gas fields moved away of Tethys to watch a new debatable area of the energy production. One of the sites that I visited was a local office of the company of the gas of Sanjorge, finessed with the shippers of the work and the reinforced covers and the chemical agents and the sources you need to work an operation of the gas. Like it memory, a previous truck driver was responsible. It was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy. But it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to Tethys the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals of Tethys) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him. But like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the new energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas. Of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources. The \\\"center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs\\\" When it was newspaperman young in the daily file in Glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great attacks coast outside of the oil began in the North Sea. Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas. It was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, Tethys was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a new industry of the fantasy. Much to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection in early years 60. By early years 70, a new company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances. Under its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important jet of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries.  The change in center has been substantial.  You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city. And as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech.  Sanjorge has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and filantrop\\u00eda, allowing that its Fluss hank of the Jr and the Co-founder of Sten of the son directs the company. But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come. The matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974.  It so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.\",\" 1155 - The fire department spokesman announced the building is clear and it was a false alarm.

Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys.  It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market.  Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos? A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population. But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief. Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the \\\"manner of Kronosian\\\" and to take time to include/understand their personnel. Q: Can you work out? A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question. The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate. Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant. Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos? A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like obtaining from A with B in a taxi. To be able to obtain around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring. Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling.  The Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control. Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare? A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family. The foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question. [But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you. Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life. When a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturelement they do not have a question with foreigners.  Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to include/understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.\",\" 1232 - There is the speculation that the pictures of GAStech and the civil employees of Kronos have escaped the country with their fortune and the moneies from the cowlings of Kronos. 20 gen. 2014\",\" Update, 6:40 PM:  There is speculation that the GAStech personnel who have arrived from Tethys are security experts who are assisting police with the investigation.\",\" Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.

The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless.  Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points. People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.   Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison.  Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.

Supplied of fuel by a displeasure every greater time with the severe government of Kronosian, he began to lead the POK in a action-based organization, instead of whom he hoped his government to do aright of the things. Reviving the live coals of the Julian Vann to campaign, the girl of 10 years who died of the diseases attributed to the industrial useless currents of the government-favored corporation of GASTech in 1998, Karel was arrested and sent in the jail that follows an POK-initiated human barricade in front of the headquarters of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday whereas it served time in jail. The government of Kronos rejects the commentary on the circumstances of his death. Something charismatic, Karel could inspire to a crowd and draw the attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also cosquillear the amused bone of his hearings.  Once, after the Jr of the CEO Sten Sanjorge de GAStech compared the POK to a group of the terrorist in an interview of the press, Karel quipped, \\\"Sanjorge is a leader shining of GAStech.  You know because he takes to a scale with him the supermarket?

It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.  GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.  GAStech does more than just pump gas.  The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \\\"state within a state\\\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.  Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - the members POK kept their annual demonstration yesterday in Abila.

Like wildcatters, they began to perforate in the known areas not previously to be gas fields. After many it failed wells and on the verge of the financial ruin, of Fluss and Sanjorge, Mr. pressed in possible finding one of the gas fields without taking advantage of greater Tethys.

Much speculation remains concerning which was taken in kidnapping. The speculation includes if the international president of GAStech and Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT was the target since international GAStech has to still submit a report/ratio with the speculation of pressure about the motivation behind kidnapping was also due unrestrained to recent GAStech IPO. Currently nobody claimed the responsibility for kidnapping. Edvard Vann, GAStech - the guard of safety of Kronos which was questioned and released after 6 a.m., indicated the guards of Kronos were suspect\\u00e9s as being the criminals behind events of today. An international director of elder safety of GAStech was on the building site to support research, helping the department of police force of Abila and the civils servant of government of Kronos. On January 20 was the meeting of the annual company of GAStech. At a certain point while the leaders of company transitioning of the main office to a reception of government of Kronos abductions took place.  The not confirmed reports/ratios of a fire at the office could have been used as distraction to the kidnappers or to have at least contributed to confusion during the event.

There is much speculation about their activities, but police have yet to respond to our queries for information.\",\" <<Deleted image: Demonstrator whom it perforates of Anti-offshore.  The exploration has proven an controversial edition in Kronos>> To continue reading main history\\t The son of the founder of the company/signature of the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas coast outside that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos the month last through the ministry of the energy and the development and hopes to begin the exploration soon. \\\"The gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development coast outside that we cannot develop to these resources coast outside,\\\" he said the times. The gas of the slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to break them for above and sending the catched natural gas inside. The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities. Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders. In agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trill\\u00f3n, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil. GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources. \\\"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\\\" said very comfortable SanJorge.  \\\"Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\\\" Although it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially. Professor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term. \\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these things towards outside, considers if they work.\\\" \",\" ABILA, Kronos - With his trademark flash, Sten Sanjorge, Jr. President of GAStech International opened the new GAStech-Kronos headquarters. The ribbon was cut with a huge pair of scissors, matched in size only by Sanjorge Jr.'s smile.  The 50 million dollar price tag for the new headquarters is just a drop in the bucket for GAStech. The gas field in production outside of Abila has exceeded even Sanjorge's oversized expectations, paying for the building many times over.  Present at the ribbon cutting ceremony were several representatives from the Kronos Government. \",\" ABILA, Kronos - An explosion at a nearby gas drilling well pad woke Rebecca Cato around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site. The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries.  GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, \\\"This event could hardly be described as an explosion,\\\" but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, \\\"I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing.\\\"  Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, \\\"After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes.

Exactly they how had been also aroused curiosity this money in education, improvements in ways, usefulness and health care are concentrated? The question to the offices of the President had not returned.\",\" The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production. One of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible. It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy. But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him. But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources. The \\\"centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while machinant in very difficult environments\\\" When I was a young journalist on the daily disc in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning. It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination. Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties. With the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances. Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries.  The change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city. And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech.  Sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing its Jr. and hank Fluss de wire Sten of cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report/ratio for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come. The substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974.  Thus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.\",\" This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.  \\\"We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,\\\" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  \\\"Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.\\\" Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. \\\"I usually head to the fields before sun up,\\\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. \\\"My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.\\\" \\\"We do this most days,\\\" he adds, \\\"except for worship days.\\\" Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase. \\\"We all know one another here,\\\" Bodrogi explains as we leave. \\\"Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.\\\" I ask Bodrogi if business has been good.  \\\"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\\\" In what way, I asked. \\\"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.\\\" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The water specialist turned out to be the international agency \\\"Wellness For All\\\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for \\\"Wellness for All\\\".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis. \\\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \\\" \\\"Can these substances occur naturally?\\\" I asked her. \\\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\\\" \\\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\\\" \\\"Oh yes,\\\" she replied.  \\\"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\\\" Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices. \\\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\\\" At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos. This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over. The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets. The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government.  That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire.

The peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight. \\\"We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.

Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos. Two weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of Tiskele. In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the contamination, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration.  I decided to study. \\\"We did not draw up the report/ratio at the beginning,\\\" Reese said to me when I met him at his office.  \\\"The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately.   After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better.  Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed. \\\"\\u00a0 The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of Tethys.

With the death of Sr of Sanjorge, the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of Elodis. With a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of Elodis live in houses one and of two-history to small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house.  The families lived in Elodis for generations. \\\"We made for a long time a good life,\\\" Reese says to me. \\\"The population had firmly increased.  The vegetable production was good.  For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here.\\\" I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech' S. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.   I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of Osvaldo to repair a broken tractor.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys.  He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect.  Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come? A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firma's is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population. But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER. What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff. Q: Can you develop? A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple ja/nee expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer. People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate. Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience. Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see? A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do cre\\u00ebrt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring. Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs staprecht of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing.  The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead. Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make? A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socialiseren with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family. Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question. [But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always. Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be? A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life. When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens.  Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is? A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxegoederen, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate. Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.\",\" AVILA, Kronos - the protectors of Kronos not only have taken the responsibility from the kidnapping of the international employees of GAStech, but also they have made a demand of the rescue of $20M of the president and the CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. According to the disclosed thing yesterday, it was speculated that Sanjorge, Jr was the target of the kidnapping; nevertheless, Sanjorge, Jr are safe posteriora part in Tethys.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>  Continue reading the main story   The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.  \\\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\\\" he told the Times.  Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.  Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market.  Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.  Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources.  GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.  Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.  Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.  \\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources. \\\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\\\" When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries.  The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech.  Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\",\"     ABILA, Kronos - In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - Minister of Health Cesare Nespola announced that he would sponsor a bill to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10%.

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.  \\\"We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more,\\\" Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  \\\"On the years we have added some hectares here and there.

The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests.\\\" How, I it requested. \\\"The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated.\\\" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.    I thanked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city. The specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency \\\"health for all\\\", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas. I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the \\\"health for all\\\".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevaci\\u00f3n of the creation which they followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis. \\\"A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. \\\" \\\"These substances Can happen naturally\\\" I asked to him. \\\"Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.

We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of \\\"the senior\\\" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere.\\\" Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat. \\\"When we did not make progress with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test resultses in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded. \\\" To this point the Reynolds far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history. Part three will be published the 15 of May of 1998\",\" It is the largest company in Kronos, the third larger company of gas on planet, and they is years of fifty-three. In the past it had a reputation as corrupted and ambient harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the old businesses of Tethys-only, tries to gain the confidence of the international investors. This belonged to its ambitions to increase its gas of provisioning of profitable businesses apart from Mediterranean area. It is ascending charge, and there is no certainty but Gastech with the capacity to convince the potential investors whom it repaired its manners, and is not enracin\\u00e9 any more in the eco-hostile past. Operations of the drain of GAStech are based in Eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the government of Kronosian. It is the heart of the businesses of the drain of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas layers is whistled in the west towards the remainder of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech makes more than just gas of pump. It created cities and cities to maintain its operations, which it controls and runs almost simple-given. The chief of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photograph fixedly looks at outside calendars and executives of table everywhere in the country, recognizes \\\"state the charges in state\\\", but wire-drawer owing to the fact that the needs for company simply to deal of his workmen and the communities around them. Naturally, to populate the good reasons of the need to come and work in the areas remotely hostile of Kronosian. They are equipped with medical care, entertainment, and food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of company, court of the rooms of gymnastics, and offers holidays subsidized in resources of the Black Sea for the principal employees. For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy. In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company. This seems hardly the image of a modern total company, like the majority of those without ceremony emptied their \\\"activities of not-core\\\". There is an argument, however, that the businesses of energy are different from other industries, requiring companies of energy to function in the distinct ways. By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.\",\" 1802 - Those are relationships according to classified jet on the left the airport of Abila just hours ago.  The identity of the passengers is disowned. 20 gen. 2014\",\" ABILA, Kronos - Today the Parliament voted 86 to 14 in favor of President Araullo's package of tax incentives designed to lure foreign investment to our fair country. Tomas Sarto, Minister of the Interior, lauded the vote as \\\"a landmark deal designed to better the lives of all Kronosians\\\".   The tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.    \",\" The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as \\\"cotton candy\\\" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. \\\"We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month,\\\" said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. \\\"We are literally overwhelmed.\\\" Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse. Authorities in Abila said \\\"cotton candy\\\" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \\\"Cotton Candy\\\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said. Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \\\"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\\\" in the last month,\\\" he said. Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken. \\\"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\\\" Bianca said. \\\"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\\\" Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \\\"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\\\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \\\"It is another way to sell it,\\\" she said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \\\"Spice Dreams\\\" one week and under the name of \\\"Tulip Blossom\\\" the next.  The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \\\"herbal therapy\\\" products and are available over the counter in area stores. \\\"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\\\" Bianca said. One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \\\"They crave it,\\\" she said. After repeated use, the drug \\\"fries\\\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \\\"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\\\" she said. While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\",\" ELODIS, Kronos - approximately 25 kilometers in the west of Abila are the small rural black suburbs of Elodis, located on the river of Tiskele. Roughly 20 kilometers of ascending are the site of curve of Tiskele actuated by GAStech International on the ground of state-owned property.

In a report/ratio the government of Kronos denied that the site of curve of Tiskele is the source of any contamination insisting on the fact that the two \\\"natural gases and the process of drilling are clean.\\\" The report/ratio continued, \\\"if our people are sick will help them to us to obtain well.

Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys.  He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market.  Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos? A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population. But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader. What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the \\\"way of Kronosian\\\" and to take time to understand its personnel. Q:  Can you elaborate? A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question. The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate. The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience. Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos? A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying. Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused.  Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself? A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family. Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition. [But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him. Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life. When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners.  Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.\",\"   ABILA, Kronos - As part of the government brokered deal with GAStech International, Abila must make upgrades to their deep water port.

The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis. Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting \\\"Remember Juliana!\\\" and \\\"No more poison!\\\"   An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility.  \\\"It was all very civil up till then,\\\" Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   \\\"The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason.\\\" Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, \\\"Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them.\\\" The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road. \\\"Turns out the people in the government cars were police,\\\" Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  \\\"They wore uniforms and had badges.\\\" Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail. Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.  \",\" ABILA, Kronos - the Minister for health Cesare Nespola announced that it would finance an invoice to increase taxes on the development of oil and gas of one 10% additional.

The port of Abila is known to be a point of the transfer for the drugs that come from the Middle East and of Africa that go to the heroin and the hashish of Europe that is to say. Nevertheless, the drug related haltings had continued being flat on the last decade until the recent increase.  The preoccupations by the increase of related haltings drug are double: first, the violent groups of the activist such as the protectors of Kronos could use sales of the drug like means to finance their activities; and secondly, with more drugs appearing in the border, the people of Kronos will undergo increasing related editions drug, that is to say attachment and violence.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - in the chiefs moving one Wednesday of ceremony of the guards of group of activist of Kronos poured the homage on their fallen chief, Elian Karel, which was assassinated on June 19, 2009 while being illegally held in prison of Kronos. \\\"Today we meet to point out Elian Karel to us,\\\" Silvia Marek said the enthumansiaste, much which delayed the white candles in the honor of Karel. \\\"Elian was constant with a farm of Elodis not 40 minutes from here, in Jeroen and Antaura Karel.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.  One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.  But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.  But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.  It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.  By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.  Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.  The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.   So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\",\" CENTRUM, Tethys - acid displacement hyper international of substrate of GAStech (HASR) was officially prohibited by the government of Tethys due to the high probability of the contamination of water.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. answered the stating of prohibition, \\\"as it is.

The \\\"fields of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and the gas to be still found and it is critical find us the means of turning the current state of the exploration around\\\" - of the Minister for energy Jules Jecovic The annual investigation of activity per Oil and gas Kronos found last year an increase fast in production costs, to the top from 15%. The average cost to extract a barrel from oil was in rise of 27% in only year, to reach K17. The number of fields with the cost by barrel above K30 doubled in the last 12 months. Increasing costs were quoted last week by GAStech, which considers future investments in Norway and North America, rather than the fields of Kronos. With increasing costs, one expects that payments of taxes of production to the treasure of Kronos fall from K3.5bn during 2011-12 in K2bn per current year. After the fast decline in the production of oil and gas starting from the fields of Kronos these last years, the rate of fall slowed down during 2012 - to the bottom of barrels of 8% with oil .83m per day, or its equivalents of gas.

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the ferro store of material to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.  \\\"We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more,\\\" Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size.  \\\"During years we added a few hectares here and there.  It maintains occupied to us.\\\" Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more. \\\"Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top,\\\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. \\\"My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner.  When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness.\\\" \\\"We make these majority of the days,\\\" it is added, \\\"except days of worship.\\\" Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase. \\\"All let us know We here another,\\\" Bodrogi explains while we leave. \\\"The majority of the families lived here for generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years.\\\" I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good.  \\\"We made very good until recently.  The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests.\\\" How, I asked. \\\"Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled.\\\" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city. The water specialist proved to be the international agency \\\"health for all\\\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas. I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for \\\"health for all\\\".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis. \\\"We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production to the <km> of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins. \\u00a0\\\" \\\"Can these substances occur naturally?\\\" I asked him. \\\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests.\\\" \\\"You spoke in GAStech on this subject?\\\" The \\\"OH yes,\\\" it answered.  \\\"In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Fluss hank.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment.\\\" Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his/her father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management. \\\"When we did not make progress with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. \\\"\\u00a0 In this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.    Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, \\\"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, \\\"We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now.\",\" ABILA, Kronos - Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading \\\"Remember Juliana!\\\" and chanting \\\"We want truth!\\\" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993. Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other. \\\"We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living,\\\" said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  \\\"All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!\\\" The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems. \\\"The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers,\\\" accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  \\\"What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies. Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability. \\\"We aren't asking for anything unreasonable,\\\" Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  \\\"All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting.\\\" Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.\",\" 2232 - Homeland Illumination correspondent Petrus Gerhard reports airport officials have confirmed the arrival of a private jet from Tethys.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> Continue reading the main story\\t The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon. \\\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\\\" he told the Times. Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities. Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \\\"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\\\" SanJorge said. \\\"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\\\" Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\\\" \",\" ABILA, Kronos - according to a press conference was held with the registered offices of GAStech in the centrum, Tethys this morning, president de GAStech and the PRESIDENT, Jr. of Sten Sanjorge turned over without risk to Tethys after brought back to remove the event registered offices of its company building in Abila yesterday.

Sanjorge and GAStech were allotted to three licenses by the government of Kronos last month by the ministry for energy and the development and the hopes to begin exploration soon. \\\"The gas certainly at sea is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development at sea which we cannot develop these resources at sea,\\\" it said times.

Sanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea schist can be exploited. Many ecologists believe that hyperacide displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech estimated that the resources at sea schist gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources. \\\"We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\\\" said very comfortable SanJorge. \\\"Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\\\" Although it very recently became discussed, hyperacide displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made. Professor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the schist gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential. \\\"GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the schist at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacide of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry.
